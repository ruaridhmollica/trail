They can reach 15-25 metres (49-82 feet) Occasionally 30metres (100 feet) tall. Betula pendula is a hardy tree that appreciates dry, acid soil. It will often be the first tree to appear on wasteland. It has an open canopy which allows other plants to flourish below. In the Highlands of Scotland, wild edible mushrooms known as Chanterelles grow happily underneath them as they have a symbiotic association with the roots of the tree. Betula pendula is Finland’s national tree, and its wood is used for furniture making, plywood, veneers, skis, utensils and firewood. The sap can be tapped and drunk fresh or used for wine making.",

It is native to the Caucasus mountains at the intersection of Europe and Asia. It has been widely planted across Europe to mitigate expected forest decline caused by climate changes.

It has a very extensive root system and should not be planted within 12 metres (40 feet) of buildings. Because it is tolerant of salt winds and is fast growing, it is often used as a shelterbelt tree.
